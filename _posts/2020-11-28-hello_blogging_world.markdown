Part of my Flatiron Data Science Bootcamp is to write blog posts about my progress and the Data Science Cohort experience in general.


Following the time-honored programmers' tradition, this is my inaugural, **Hello World** post.


After building a successful and rewarding career as a software engineer, I wanted to shift into the data science field. I had taken a few online courses here and there and had even done a few work projects in data analysis but I wanted to take the next step with a more formal and intensive data science program. 


The stars truly aligned when I learned of both the[ Flatiron School's Online Data Science Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/online) and [NCWIT Regional Initiatives](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/online)' scholarship opportunities. I applied for and was accepted to the Online Full Time Data Science 081720 Cohort.


Our Cohort is apparently one of the largest Online Cohorts currently at Flatiron. We have members located across the country and from many different fields and backgrounds. We meet every weekday on Zoom, share our code on GitHub, and collaborate and mingle on Slack. This remote-first world has become the New Normal in 2020 due to COVID-19. My fellow cohort members, Instructor, and Ed Coach have done a fantastic job of creating a true sense of community and a true support system as we progress together though the program.


My thoughts so far? The pace is fast, the material is challenging, the expectations and standards are high. Growth comes along with being pushed outside your comfort zone, so Iâ€™m thankful for the challenges and look forward to rising to meet them.


Much more to come....
